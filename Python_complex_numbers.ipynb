    "where $a$ is the real part and $b$ is the imaginary part. Here $a$ and $b$ are real numbers.\n",

    "Python includes complex numbers as a fundamental datatype (unlike most programming languages). \n",

    "Let's create some examples of complex numbers in Python. We'll use variable names z, u, v, w for complex numbers.\n",
