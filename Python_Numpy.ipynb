    "# Python Libraries and Numpy\n",

    "\n",
    "## Importing Libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "A library is a collection of functions and tools that typically serve a related purpose. They\n",
    "save you from having to write a lot of code yourself. Python has libraries, modules and\n",
    "packages, which all serve the same general role but are technically different. However, for ease of\n",
    "discussion, we will use the term library to cover all of these.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use a library, you must first import it using the `import` keyword. You can also use the `as` keyword to provide an alias, for example if you don't want to have to type a long library name repeatedly.\n",
    "In the example below, we import the library `my_library` using the alias `ml`.\n",
    "```\n",
    "    import my_library as ml\n",
    "```\n",
    "## Numpy\n",
    "\n",
    "The `numpy` library (pronounced num - pie) is a library of numerical functions and tools that are useful in scientific computing, data science and machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's import it and use some of its features. We will start by looking at what you can do with numpy arrays, which are basically lists of numbers (or some other type of data)."
