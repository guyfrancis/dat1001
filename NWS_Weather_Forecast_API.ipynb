    "In this notebook, we will use the National Weather Service (NWS) Application Programming Interface (API) to get weather forecast data. We will then plot some charts to show the weather forecast for a given location. To plot the charts, we will use the `matplotlib` library.\n",

    "Getting weather data from the NWS is more complicated that a making single HTTP request. We first tell the `api.weather.gov` server where we are in terms of latitude and longitude. The response then allows use to get a forecast based on the nearest available weather station and its grid system for forecasting. The first response will tell us a grid point near to our location, which we can them use to get a forecast with a second HTTP request.\n",
