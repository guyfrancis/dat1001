    "Starting in the 1960s and 1970s, a movement began in computer science called *object-oriented programming* (OOP). The idea behind OOP was to make computer programs more structured, robust and manageable, avoiding what is know as 'spaghetti code.' The movement really took off in the 1980s and 1990s with the adoption of C++, Java and other widely-used OOP languages. Python has many OOP features.\n",
