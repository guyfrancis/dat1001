    "# Python Code Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will cover some basic features of the Python language, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Code sequencing\n",
    "- Conditional statements (branching)\n",
    "- Loops\n",
    "- Functions\n",
    "- Objects and classes\n",
    "\n",
    "These features are fundamental to most programming languages, although the syntax for different languages will differ. This isn't a programming course, so you are not expected to have a *deep* understanding of Python coding, but familiarity with some key features of Python coding will help you a lot.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Code Sequencing\n",
    "This just means that, absent any other instructions, lines of code get executed in order, one after another. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, look at the code below:\n",
    "```\n",
    "x = 3\n",
    "print(x)\n",
    "x = x + 1\n",
    "print(x)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here the lines of code get executed in order. The variable `x` is given the value `3` first. Then the value of `x` is printed. Then `1` is added to the value of `x` and the new value `4` is printed.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is not much more to say about sequencing, but it is worth bearing in mind that when you are runnning Python code in cells, all of the previously run code will apply, unless you restart the **kernel**. The kernel is basically the program that takes your lines of code and executes them on the server, retuning any output to your notebook."

    "## Conditional statements\n",
    "\n",
    "One reason why computers are powerful is because they can make decisions based on inputs. Decisions are made based on whether a boolean expression evaluates to `True` or `False`. Which lines of code are executed are conditional on the value of the boolean expression. This is called **branching**. The code below illustrates this using an `if-else` statement format in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code below. It's best to try it multiple times with different inputs, to understand what is happening."
