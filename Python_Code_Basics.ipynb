    "One reason why computers are powerful is because they can make decisions based on inputs. Decisions are made based on whether a boolean expression evaluates to True or False. Which lines of code are executed are conditional on the value of the boolean expression. This is also called branching. The code below illustrates this using an *if-then* statement format in Python. Run the code below. It's best to try it multiple times with different inputs, to understand what is happening."

    "In the 1960s and 1970s, a movement began in computer science called 'object-oriented programming.' The idea behind OOP was to make computer programs more structured, robust and manageable, avoiding what is know as 'spaghetti code.' OOP aims make code more structured and manageable buy using objects which combine related data and functions into a single entity, known as an object. The template for an object is a class.\n",
