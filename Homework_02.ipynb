    "\n",
    "This homework assignment covers some of the basics of Python coding that we covered in Week 2, including if statements, for and while loops, and functions. The first few exercises test your basic coding skills and the last few parts bring this together in a data processing task.\n",

    "**Grading Rubric**: Each question is scored on a scale of 0-4 where 4 = completely correct and 0 = completely incorrect / no answer. Your total score is then calculated as a percentage of the maximum points possible and rescaled to be out of 10."
