    "Strings are arrays (ordered lists of characters). We can get parts of the string by using **indexing**. A part of a string is called a *substring*. For example, consider the following code:\n",
    "```\n",
    "my_str = \"How long is a piece of string?\"\n",

In Python **we start counting with 0**, so position 2 corresponds to the letter 'w' in my_str. We always us square brackets `[` and `]` in Python to reference parts of a string."
