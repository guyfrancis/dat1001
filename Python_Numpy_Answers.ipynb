    "The file \"Denver_Daily_Temps_2021-25.csv\" contains the daily high, low and average temperatures for Denver for the years 2021-2025, so from Jan 01 2021 to Dec 31 2025. The units are degrees celsius. These data are taken from the [Meteostat](https://meteostat.net/en/) website.\n",

    "Before you run any Python code, take a look at the CSV file. You'll see that there are 11 columns. We will use columns 1, 2, 3, which cover average temp (tavg), minimum temperate (tmin), maximum temperature (tmax) as in the example above. Remember you will need to convert the temperature units to degrees Fahrenheit and use the `np.T` method to transpose the data.\n",

    "3. What was the average temperature over the 5-year period?\n",
    "4. What day in the 5-year period had the smallest temperature range, and what was it, in deg F?\n",
    "5. (Challenge) Find the maximum temperature range in each year 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024 and 2025. Do these all occur roughly around the same time of year?"
